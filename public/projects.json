Peak accuracy was 89% after using focal loss to combat the overrepresentation of residential buildings in the sample. I eventually adapted this technology with a publically available segmentation model so that it could accept a single input image and classify all of the buildings automatically. This took some time but was a lot of fun upon completion." }
